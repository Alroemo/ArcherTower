<h1><b>ARCHER TOWER</b></h1>

<p>A two player game using the processing drawing engine, which was developed with the Java Language</p>
<p>Made for the creating of a game assignment for my ART 295 class at PSU, fall 2014</p>

<p>Involves two players: one is the knight on the left who must get to the other side; the other is an archer on the right side who shoots arrows to stop the knight from getting to the other side. If the knight gets to the other side, the knight wins, if the knight does not make it in time, the archer wins.</p>

<p>The knight is controlled using the arrow keys on the keyboard to move left and right. The archer is controlled using the mouse with left click to shoot an arrow. </p>
